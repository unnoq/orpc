 * The ad-slot inventory, plus the helpers that shape it for rendering. Slots

 * scripts/sync-sponsors.ts distils that into slots.ts; positions are fixed and

 * that names it.
 *
 * Deliberately free of any sponsors.ts import: client.ts needs this module, and
 * the sponsor wall's data has no business in the browser bundle — slots.ts
 * carries only the handful of sponsors that bought a position.
