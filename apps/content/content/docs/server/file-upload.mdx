## Introduction

oRPC simplifies file uploads, providing built-in support for handling files 
seamlessly without any restriction or configuration. 
This guide walks you through the process of uploading files using oRPC.

### Basic File Upload Example

oRPC allows you to define file upload handlers with ease. 
In this example, we define an endpoint that accepts a file input:

```typescript
import { os } from '@orpc/server'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const uploadFile = os.input(
    z.object({ file: z.instanceof(File) })
).handler(async (input) => {
    const file: File = input.file
    // Handle the file as needed, e.g., save to storage, process, etc.
})
```

> **Note:** The `z.instanceof(File)` schema used here works well for basic usage but may not provide full validation or flexibility for complex requirements.

## Enhanced File Upload with `@orpc/zod`

To improve file type validation, oRPC offers additional schemas in the `@orpc/zod` package. 
This includes specialized schemas for common types like `File`, `Blob`, `URL`, and `RegExp`. 
With these, you can apply more granular constraints, such as file type filtering for images or other media formats.

### Using the Enhanced File Schema

Here's an example using `oz.file()` from `@orpc/zod`, which allows specifying a file type restriction for images:

```typescript
import { os } from '@orpc/server'
import { oz } from '@orpc/zod'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const uploadFile = os.input(
    z.object({ file: oz.file().type('image/*') })
).handler(async (input) => {
    const image: File = input.file 
    // Process the image file as needed
})

export const appRouter = os.router({
  uploadFile,
})
```

In this example, `oz.file().type('image/*')` restricts uploads to image files only, improving type safety and preventing invalid file types from being uploaded.

## Client Usage for File Upload

To upload files with oRPC from the client, set up an oRPC client 
and pass a `File` object directly to the upload endpoint.

```typescript
import { createORPCClient } from '@orpc/client'
import { ORPCLink } from '@orpc/client/fetch'

const orpcLink = new ORPCLink({
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/api',
  // fetch: optional override for the default fetch function
  // headers: provide additional headers
})

const client = createORPCClient<typeof appRouter>(orpcLink)

// Example: Upload a file from an HTML file input
const fileInput = document.getElementById('file-input') as HTMLInputElement
fileInput.onchange = async () => {
  const file = fileInput.files?.[0]
  if (file) {
    try {
      const response = await client.uploadFile({ file })
      console.log('File uploaded successfully:', response)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Upload failed:', error)
    }
  }
}
```

### HTML Example

```html
<input type="file" id="file-input" />
```

Just select a file, and it will be uploaded to the server using the `uploadFile` endpoint. 
With oRPC's type-safe client, both input and output are fully typed, 
making it simple to handle file uploads effectively.
