Enhance the performance of your oRPC router with lazy-loaded routers.
Lazy routers in oRPC allow you to defer the loading of specific router modules until they're actually needed. 
This can improve startup times and optimize resource usage, especially for large applications.


## Overview 

Lazy routers make your application modular and efficient without sacrificing ease of use. 
Here's how you can set up and use them:

```typescript twoslash
import { os } from '@orpc/server'

const pub = os.context<{ user?: { id: string } } | undefined>()

// Define a router with lazy loading
const router = pub.router({
    lazy: pub.lazy(() => import('examples/server')),
    // Please use .prefix when you use OpenAPI
    better: pub.prefix('/some').lazy(() => import('examples/server'))
})

// Use the lazy-loaded router as if it were a regular one
const output = await router.lazy.getUser({ id: '123' })
```

### Key Points:
1. **Export Requirement:**
   The `examples/server.ts` file must export a router as the default export. Example:  
   ```ts twoslash
   import { os } from '@orpc/server'

   export default os.router({
       // something
   })
   ```

2. **Seamless Functionality:**
   Once the lazy router is loaded, it behaves exactly like a standard router. You don't need to configure anything extra or worry about limitations.

3. **OpenAPI Compatibility (Optional):**
   Although not required, using the `prefix` method when defining a lazy router is highly recommended for OpenAPI integration.

   ```ts twoslash
    import { os } from '@orpc/server'
    const pub = os.context<{ user?: { id: string } }>()

    const lazy = pub.prefix('/some').lazy(() => import('examples/server'))
    ```

    Adding a prefix helps oRPC dynamically load the router only when it's needed, 
    improving efficiency and alignment with OpenAPI specifications. While optional, 
    incorporating prefixes will greatly benefit your application by streamlining routing behavior.

By using lazy routers, you can keep your application modular and efficient while maintaining the same user-friendly API you're used to.
