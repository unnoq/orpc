# H3 Adapter

[H3](https://h3.dev/) is a universal, tiny, and fast web framework built on top of web standards. For additional context, refer to the [HTTP Adapter](/docs/adapters/http) guide.

## Basic

```ts
import { H3, serve } from 'h3'
import { RPCHandler } from '@orpc/server/fetch'

const app = new H3()

const handler = new RPCHandler(router)

app.use('/rpc/**', async (event) => {
  const { matched, response } = await handler.handle(event.req, {
    prefix: '/rpc',
    context: {} // Provide initial context if needed
  })

  if (matched) {
    return response
  }
})

serve(app, { port: 3000 })
```

::: info
The `handler` can be any supported oRPC handler, such as [RPCHandler](/docs/rpc-handler), [OpenAPIHandler](/docs/openapi/openapi-handler), or another custom handler.
