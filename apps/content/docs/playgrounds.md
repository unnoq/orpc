## Local Development

If you prefer working locally, you can clone any playground using the following commands:

```bash
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/next orpc-next-playground
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/tanstack-start orpc-tanstack-start-playground
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/nuxt orpc-nuxt-playground
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/solid-start orpc-solid-start-playground
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/svelte-kit orpc-svelte-kit-playground
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/astro orpc-astro-playground
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/contract-first orpc-contract-first-playground
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/nest orpc-nest-playground
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/cloudflare-worker orpc-cloudflare-worker-playground
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/electron orpc-electron-playground
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/browser-extension orpc-browser-extension-playground
```

For each project, set up the development environment:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

That's it! You can now access the playground at `http://localhost:3000`.
